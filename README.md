## Description

This project is a simple responive landing page for the Base Apparel shop in which I practice more on the use of Gulp.js for automating tasks. Also, I used sass for the styling and GSAP for the loading animation. The main feature in this project is email validation using regular expressions.

## Technologey

- Sass
- GSAP
- Gulp.js

## Quickstart guide

After cloning the repo if you already have gulp CLI you can just install the dependencies by running the following commands

```bash
npm install
```

and then run gulp to run the default Gulp task

```bash
gulp
```

In case you do not have the Gulp CLI, you should first install gulp globally.

```bash
npm install --global gulp-cli
```

You can find more info about gulp started [here](https://gulpjs.com/docs/en/getting-started/quick-start)
